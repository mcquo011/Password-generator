## Usage

Use this site to generate a random password. First, enter in the desired length of the password (8< x < 128). If you enter a number outside of the required length, an alert will pop up. The user then prompted to selected which characters they'd like in their password, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Atleast one character set needs to be selected or an alert will pop up saying, "Select at least one character set!" A random password will then be displayed for the user to use.
